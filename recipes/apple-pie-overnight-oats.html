        <h2>A simple, delicious overnight oat recipe that is easy to prep for busy schedules.</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup apple pieces</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 tbsp maple syrup</li>
            <li>1 pinch sea salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup unsweetened plain almond milk/dairy-free milk of choice</li>
            <li>1 tbsp chia seeds</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp maple syrup</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>2 tbsp creamy unsalted cashew or almond butter</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 cup rolled oats</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Add chopped apples, cinnamon, maple syrup, and salt,
                mix to evenly distribute cinnamon.
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn heat on low and cover. Cook while sturing occasionally for ~10 minutes or until apples are tender.
                Remove the lid and turn heat up to medium.
                Cook for 2-3 more minutes, stirring occasionally.
                Once most of the liquid is gone, turn off heat and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                In small bowl or measuring cup, mix almond milk, chia seeds,
                maple syrup, cinnamon, nut butter, and vanilla.
                Add the oats and stir until well-combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Get two small mason jars or bowls with lids.
                Place roughly one quarter of the apple mixture into the bottom
                of each container. Add half of the oat mixture to each, then
                split the rest of the apple mixture between the containers as
                a topping for the oats. Place in the refridgerator overnight 
                or for at least 6 hours.
            </li>   
        </ol>
